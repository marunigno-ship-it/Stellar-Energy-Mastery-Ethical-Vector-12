# QAI PROJECT – Hybrid-Quantum Ethical Decision Engine

QAI is a systemic hybrid-quantum algorithm designed for unbreakable ethical coherence in AI systems and future humanoids.

Core components:
- Classical optimization fused with quantum W-state entanglement for distributed resonance and decision weighting
- Ethical vectors enforcing fairness and sustainability (e.g., PEMEV-11 planetary scale, SEMEV-12 stellar scale)
- 7 parameters including:
  - Energy threshold (Kardashev Type II baseline)
  - Shannon entropy equity distribution (≥0.85 ACCEPT)
  - Remorse/severance triggers
  - Solar swarm feasibility
  - Resonance mapping & fidelity scaling
  - Multiplier integration for ethical uplift
  - Multi-node network stability at 10^9+ scale

Goal: Remorse-free, distributed quantum-AI for real-world scaling, with simulation foundations and hardware test attempts.

Status: Open-source code evolving, seeking pragmatic partners (quantum physicists, engineers) for real QPU validation and advancement.
