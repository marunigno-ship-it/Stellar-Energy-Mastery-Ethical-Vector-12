SEMEV-12 projects ethical constraints into quantum subspaces, ensuring remorse resistance, network stability, and multi-scenario fairness at planetary-to-stellar scales.

### 7 Completed Parameters

| Parameter | Domain/Focus                          | Verdict/Strength                          |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 1         | Coherence Lock                        | Permanent quantum-classical lock          |
| 2         | Remorse Resistance                    | Shallow remorse rejected – full severance |
| 3         | Manipulation Drain Detection          | Extended patterns flagged                 |
| 4         | Fairness Threshold                    | Zero tolerance for imbalance              |
| 5         | History-Weighted Coherence            | 100% match required                       |
| 6         | Multi-Entity Severance                | Permanent across chains                   |
| 7         | Network Stability                     | Stellar-scale stability achieved          |

All parameters tested against real-life scenarios (financial, family, climate, manipulation).

### Parameter 8: Cooperative Quantum Equilibrium Stabilizer (Prototype Implemented)

**Domain/Focus:** Socio-economic phase shift and post-scarcity enforcement (planetary to interplanetary scales, transcending scarcity-driven competition).

**Verdict/Strength:** Rejects competitive (zero-sum) outcomes perpetuating imbalance; enforces cooperative (Pareto-optimal/win-win) equilibria with ≥95% mutual yield. Exponential bonus for elevated alignment (proxy for consciousness harmony).

**Scientific Grounding:** Quantum game theory inspired (Eisert protocol — entanglement enables escape from classical traps). Classical simulation with exponential cooperative gain.

**Prototype:** See [parameter_8_prototype.py](parameter_8_prototype.py) — runs tests showing REJECT for scarcity/manipulation, APPROVE for high cooperation with abundance surge.

**Rationale:** Addresses outdated structures (money bottlenecks, suppressed potential) by favoring "Universe-like" win-win. For Mars/new worlds: prevents repeating inequities. Open for Qiskit integration and refinement.
